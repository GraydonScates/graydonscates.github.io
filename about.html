                As you may have guessed by now, my name is Graydon Scates and I am both a programmer and a retro gaming fan. I started my coding journey with RPG Maker 2000 and simple HTML pages during middle school and never looked back. After moving from Atlanta to Orlando I attended Full Sail University and graduated Salutatorian with a Bachelor's degree in Digital Art and Design, which was a fun degree to be in as one of the only programming focused people surrounded by more creative artistic types. However, the creative skills I picked up from my classmates ultimately helped to get me where I am today, as did my ability to self-teach any programming language I come across.<br>
                <br>
                For the last 10+ years I have been working for <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-walt-disney-company/" target="_blank">The Walt Disney Company</a> in their in-house Marketing Creative Agency, Yellow Shoes. I started out working on a range of marketing projects like emails and web banners before graduating to micro-sites and games built in Flash (RIP) and Javascript. Eventually, as I continued to grow my knowledge and skills, my duties shifted to more Software Engineering and System Administration tasks out of necessity as I was one of the few people on our small team capable of tackling these more complicated programming needs. Through all of that I developed a deep love of solving complicated application building challenges and creating software solutions used company-wide to help make the lives and jobs of my fellow Disney Cast Members easier.<br>
                <br>
                My newest adventure, aside from a constant string of personal video game projects, is teaching the MERN full stack (Mongo, Express, React &amp; Node) as an instructor for the <a href="https://bootcamp.ce.ucf.edu/coding/" target="_blank">University of Central Florida Continuing Education Coding Bootcamp</a>. I have taught over a hundred people to be full stack application developers so far and it has been one of the most fun and rewarding challenges I have ever taken on. At this point I don't ever see myself not teaching in some form, as long as my day job continues to afford me the time to do so.<br>
